# Travel Destinations

A simple app to keep track of destinations I'd like to visit.

Launch app with index.html. You are then presented with a number
buttons representing the destinations. Scroll over the buttons,
and you will see that the destinations behave responsively
(text tilts clockwise).

The app is part of course "Github & Collaboration".  This course
is divided into 3 parts:

* Working with Remotes
* Working on another developers repository
* Staying in sync with a remote repository
